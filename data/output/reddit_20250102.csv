1hr5qg1,Data Lake Raw Layer Best Practices,4,10,_Paul_Atreides_,2025-01-01 16:02:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1hr5qg1/data_lake_raw_layer_best_practices/,False,False,False,False,0,"Hello!  I'm running into issues setting up the raw layer of a data lake - the guidance I've found online seems a bit handwavy and it's not clear what the best way to proceed would be.  Some specific examples:

* Store on original format

Makes total sense - but I'm ingesting a lot of large .csv files.  Shouldn't I compress them to save on storage costs?  But, there's also (many) pdfs, I'd rather compress everything in the same way than have some datasets (or some file types) compressed, and others not.


* Folder/key conventions

Storing objects with year=2025/month=01/day=01 of the date of ingest makes sense makes ingest pipeline easier and allows for 'point in time' analysis but when ingesting old data (e.g. new vendor provides monthly data for the past 5 years) results in all that data arriving 'today' and it makes it likely that future data analysts using the data lake will not easily find it.

* Object naming

The CW is that individual objects should be renamed but if you use the source_dataset_date.{original extension} format you loose metadata from the provided name and context from any nested in folders.  But if you keep the original name, there's chaos (special characters in file names, capitalization, wonky nested folders, etc) and it's not standard across different datasets (and sometimes within).  Lastly, what date to use?  If you use date of ingest, it increases the chance that analysts will not find it, or the data date - which means the key/folder organization and filename will be different- also confusing.

How do you handle these issues on your data lake?  And if you make any changes (like file name) how do you retain and make accessable the original/new information?

Background: I'm working in S3, and analyst access to the raw layer is an unavoidable requirement.

In pursuit of breaking into Data Engineering in this competitive job market, I have a solid 4.5 years of non-technical (no SQL, just Excel) DA experience and nearly 6 years of very light SDE/SWE experience (by light I mean that light dev work was only one part of my job). I do have self-taught DE skills, but I don't feel like my prior SDE/SWE experience is enough and my DA experience was quite a while ago and was non-technical.

I do have a bachelors, but it's a Liberal Arts BA. Given all that, I am leaning towards going back to DA work first is my best bet?

However, I am wondering, for those of you without a CS background who started as DAs:

Question 1) *Do you feel like the lack of CS fundamentals holds you back at all? and if yes, how so?*

I ask because my other option is to go back to school. I know that many say if you're going to get a degree, then CS is the best option. My problem is that *I'm horrible at math*, and so I also see Software Engineering degrees are a better option in that case.

Question 2) *Would a BS in Software Engineering be a good alternative for Data Engineering?*"

I work for a small distributor, where virtually all of our department data is stored and updated within Microsoft Excel. They typically use OneDrive to support concurrent users and to have an easier time sharing files. 

I work with about 8 different people. The head of the department is determined to acquire some sort of database with the purpose of storing all the data, extracting information from it with ease, and to handle multiple concurrent users (<5).

I enjoy my job a lot, but it is definitely becoming monotonous in terms of the analysis and dashboarding duties. I know that data engineering is a good next step for many analysts, and it seems like it might be the best option given a lot of other paths in the world of data.

Initially, I was interested in data science. However, I think with the massive influx of interest in that area, the sheer number of applicants with graduate degrees compared to my bachelors in biology, and the necessity of more DEs as the DS pool grows, I figured data engineering would be more my speed.

  
I also enjoy coding and the problem solving element of my current role, but am not too keen on math / stats. I also enjoy constant learning and building things. Given all of that, and paired with the fact that these roles can have relatively high salaries for 40ish hours of work a week (with many roles that are remote) it seems like a pretty sweet next step.

However, I do see a lot of people on this sub especially concerned with the growth and trajectory of their current DE gigs. I know many people say SWEs have a lot more variability in where they can grow and mold their careers, and am just wondering if there are other avenues adjacent to DE that people may recommend.

Now they're very generous and offer various data formats. The obvious choice to me was the parquet file since it clean and more compressed. However if I'm running a daily or weekly pipeline it requires downloading the whole thing again which is multi gig. This is the same for most their files. 

They do offer delta json files, but this is not the same schema as the parquet. In fact it's much more robust and not cleaned. 

So my delima is do I just keep redownloading the same parquet file and incrementally load it into my db? Or should I use the json since it's more efficient? Is there another solution I'm missing?

I hold a Ph.D. and am looking to transition into a new role, primarily for an increase in pay. In my current position, I handle a mix of responsibilities: about 80% data engineering, 10% dashboarding, and 10% R&D work, which mainly involves A/B testing.

In my current job, I primarily use Python and SQL, with some experience in CI/CD. However, other parts of my tech stack are quite niche and not widely used by employers outside my sector.

Recently, I received an offer for a Data Engineer role with a salary of $120K, a significant increase from my current $80K. The offered role seems to focus heavily on SQL and involves using SSAS/SSIS. It appears to be a newly created position for the company, which currently has several analysts but no dedicated data engineer. Their goal is to bring someone in to streamline many of their processes.

My long-term goal is to transition into an ML Engineer role. So far, my job search hasn’t gotten much for ML engineering roles. I am excited about the role because of the pay increase. To be honest, I find myself enjoying the coding and software development aspects of my work far more than the research side. I’m growing tired of managing stakeholders’ expectations, hacking together scripts, and working under tight deadlines.

My question is: would accepting this role be a good step for my career? While I feel this position could help me grow as a data engineer, it likely won’t involve any R&D work in the near future. Could this hurt my ability to transition into an ML Engineer role later on? Alternatively, should I turn down the offer and continue my job search?"

My approach is to have some prefixes in my S3 bucket like `platform_1/orders/{to_load,loaded,errors}`, and files have their prefix changed once they've been treated as such - assume the files/objects are named with a timestamp or date (e.g., `2024-12-31T123456.json`. Each time I call whatever `load()` function, I'll run it on all files in `*/to_load/`. If ever there's an error in the load process, it'll move to `*/errors/` for later inspection. If successful, it'll have its prefix changed to `*/loaded/`, and from there we can decide to remove the data as we know it exists in the database.

My friend insists that it's not that solid of a plan, as I should just use Airflow to run `load()` on ""yesterday's"" or ""today's"" data. This will remove the need for keeping track of the stages based on the prefix.

I admittedly haven't used Airflow, and all of this is just written through a native and naive Python implementation, but wouldn't this still be more effective if through Airflow I just run `load()` on the `*/to_load/` prefix?

When I discussed this with the interviewer, I didn't say I haven't used Airflow, but I assume this is a tell that I don't have experience with it?"

I wanted to share something I’ve been working on and get your thoughts. Like many of you, I’ve relied on notebooks for exploration and prototyping: they’re incredible for quickly testing ideas and playing with data. But when it comes to building something reusable or interactive, I’ve often found myself stuck.  
For example:

* I wanted to turn some analysis into a simple tool for teammates to use.. something interactive where they could tweak parameters and get results. But converting a notebook into a proper app always seemed to spiral into setting up dashboards, learning front-end frameworks, and stitching things together.
* I often wish I had a fast way to create polished, interactive apps to share findings with stakeholders. Not everyone wants to navigate a notebook, and static reports lack the dynamic exploration that’s possible with an app.
* Sometimes I need to validate transformations or visualize intermediate steps in a pipeline. A quick app to explore those results can be useful, but building one often feels like overkill for what should be a quick task.

These challenges led me to start tinkering with a small open src project which is a lightweight framework to simplify building and deploying simple data apps. That said, I’m not sure if this is universally useful or just scratching my own itch. I know many of you have your own tools for handling these kinds of challenges, and I’d love to learn from your experiences.

If you’re curious, I’ve open-sourced the project on GitHub ([https://github.com/StructuredLabs/preswald](https://github.com/StructuredLabs/preswald)). It’s still very much a work in progress, and I’d appreciate any feedback or critique.

Ultimately, I’m trying to learn more about how others tackle these challenges and whether this approach might be helpful for the broader community. Thanks for reading—I’d love to hear your thoughts!"

Most lineage tools focus on column-level lineage, showing how data moves between tables and columns. While helpful, this leaves a gap for business users who need to understand the fine-grained logic within those transformations. They're left wondering, ""Okay, I see this column came from that column or that table, but how was it calculated?""

Reasons for short comes mainly because of:

Intricate ETL or ELT Processes: Data processes can involve complex transformations, making it difficult to trace the exact flow of data and the what’s involved in each calculation.

Custom Code and Scripts: Lineage tracking tools struggle to analyse and interpret lineage from custom code or scripts used in data processing.

Large Data Volumes: Tracking cell level lineage for massive datasets can be computationally intensive and require significant storage

So now i'm wondering, what's next? What do I begin to focus on as I work toward my next job and step in my career? It looks like the big steps are ETL in Python, git gud at SQL, or start learning cloud technologies. I just finished a community college class on AWS and enjoyed that, so i'm open to learning the cloud environment more but i thought to ask you all, as someone who has a Data Engineering 101 job (pretty small datasets, pretty simple data modeling compared to what I was working with and doing at my previous job), what might be a good thing to learn? 

I've enjoyed the healthcare industry, and I want to work in the aerospace industry, so maybe that could help your feedback?

Databrew seems like it offers this, and has the benefit of allowing non-DE to make their own recipes that I could then just call inside my pipeline. The downside i potentially see is lack of standardization,  but thats what I'm wondering.

My friend and I are working on a machine learning project focused on recognizing Indian Sign Language (ISL) gestures using deep learning. We’re seeking feedback and suggestions from computer vision experts to help improve our approach and results.

# Project Overview

Our goal is to develop a robust model for recognizing ISL gestures. We’ve used a 50-word subset of the INCLUDE dataset, which is a video dataset. Each word has an average of 21 videos, and we performed an 80:20 train-test split.

# Dataset Preprocessing

1. **Video to Frames:** We created a custom dataset loader to extract frames from videos.
2. **Landmark Extraction:** Frames were passed through Mediapipe to extract body pose and hand landmarks.
3. **Handling Missing Data:** Linear interpolation was applied to handle missing landmark points in frames.
4. **Data Augmentation:**
   * **Random Horizontal Flip:** Applied with a 30% probability.

# Model Training and Results

We trained two models on the preprocessed dataset:

1. **ResNet18 + GRU:** Achieved 88.74% test accuracy with a test loss of 0.2813.
2. **r3d18:** Achieved 89.18% test accuracy with a test loss of 0.7433.

# Challenges Faced

We experimented with additional augmentations like random rotations (-7.5° to 7.5°) and random cropping, but these significantly reduced test accuracy for both models.

# What We’re Looking For

We’d appreciate feedback on:

1. **Model Architectures:** Suggestions for improving performance or alternative architectures to try.
2. **Augmentation Techniques:** Guidance on augmentations that could help improve model robustness.
3. **Overfitting Mitigation:** Strategies to prevent overfitting while maintaining high test accuracy.
4. **Evaluation Metrics:** Are we missing any key metrics or evaluations to validate our models better?

You can find our code and implementation details in the GitHub repository: [SignLink-ISL](https://github.com/Naneet/SignLink-ISL)

Thank you for your time and insights. We’re eager to hear your suggestions to take our project to the next level!"

I am currently a ""Data Analyst"" in my current job (government statistics in Europe) , producing reports and econometrics studies. I dont think I am really a data Analyst only  because I have the role of handling data from beginning to end and creating econometrics models. I am currently using R studio cloud and duckdb to work on a on premise storage system. I cannot have access to other tools except reticulate. 

For the moment everything is quite messy in my worfklow. All my data is stocked inside a ""raw data folder"" and my files are like ""1.import"" , ""2.clean"" '""3.join"" .... 
I have several same R projects at the same time but sometimes I need data from 1 project for an other. So i have to copy data from project 1 to project 2 which is not ideal.

I want to transition into DE in my next job so I would like to have some stuff I could value with recruiters
I'm currently learning DE on datacamp and I already identified following :

- Data modeling : try to organize better data , create a snowflake schema and normalize data.
- Reproducibility : Use targets package or mage for orchestration (even if new data comes only every 6 months). Transform my pipeline as a R package and use CI/CD , docker and git.
- SE practices : DRY, make little modular chunks as functions for my code.

Do you have other ideas of best DE practices I could implement ?

Thanks a lot,"

1hpjthk,Do you use constraints in your Data Warehouse?,5,26,jagdarpa,2024-12-30 09:44:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1hpjthk/do_you_use_constraints_in_your_data_warehouse/,False,False,False,False,1,"My client has a small (in volume) data warehouse in Oracle. All of the tables have constraints applied to them: uniqueness, primary keys and foreign keys. For example every fact table has foreign keys to the associated dimension tables, and all hubs in the data vault have a uniqueness constraint on the business key.

Before updating the DWH (a daily batch) we generally disable all constraints, and then re-enable all of them after the batch has completed. We use simple stored procedures for this. But the re-enabling of constraints is slow.

Besides that, it’s a bit annoying to work with in the dev environment. For example if you need to make changes to a dim table and you want to test your work, first you’ll have to disable all FK constraints in all the tables that reference that dimension.

Lately we have been discussing whether we really need some of those constraints. Particularly the FK constraints seem to have a limited purpose in a data warehouse. They ensure referential integrity, but there are other ways to check for that (like running tests).

Have you seen this kind of use of constraints in a DWH? Is it considered a good practice? Or do you use a cloud DWH with limited support for constraints?"

We have worked on multiple projects with BigQuery for customers who already had it in place. 

  
There is a lot of misconception on the market that Snowflake is more expensive than other solutions.  This is not true. It all comes down to ""data architecture"". A lot of startup rushes to Snowflake, create tables, and import data without having a clear understanding of what they're trying to accomplish. 

They'll use an overprovisioned warehouse unit, which does not include the auto-shutdown option (which we usually set to 15 seconds after no activity), and use that warehouse unit for everything, making it difficult to determine where the cost comes from. 

We always create a warehouse unit per app/process, department, or group.   
Transformer (DBT), Loader (Fivetran, Stitch, Talend), Data\_Engineer, Reporting (Tableau, PowerBI) ...   
When you look at your cost management, you can quickly identify and optimize where the cost is coming from. 

Furthermore, Snowflake has a recourse monitor that you can set up to alert you when a warehouse unit reaches a certain % of consumption. This is great once you have your warehouse setup and you ant to detect anomalies. You can even have the rule shutdown the warehouse unit to avoid further cost. 

Storage: The cost is close to BigQuery. $23/TB vs $20/TB.   
Snowflake also allows querying S3 tables and supports icebergs. 

I personally like the Time Travel (90 days, vs 7 days with bigquery). 

Most of our clients data size is < 1TB. Their average compute monthly cost is < $100.  
We use DBT, we use dimensional modeling, we ingest via Fivetran, Snowpipe etc ...

We always start with the smallest warehouse unit. (And I don't think we ever needed to scale). 

At $120/month, it's a pretty decent solution, with all the features Snowflake has to offer. 

What's your experience?"

Both are partitioned on purchase month and retailer. A foreign key exists on receiptitems (receiptid) referencing id on receipts. 

Data gets inserted into these tables by an application that reads raw data files and creates tables from them that are broken out by the purchase month and retailer in a different schema. It’s done this way so that multiple processes can be running concurrently and avoid deadlocks while trying to insert into the target schema. 

Another process gets a list of raw data that has completed importing and threads the insert into the target schema by purchase month inserting directly into the correct purchase month retailer partition and avoiding deadlocks. 

My issue is that the insert from these tables in the raw schema to the public schema is taking entirely too long. My suspicion is that the foreign key constrain is causing the slow down. Would I see a significant performance increase by removing the foreign key constraint on the parents and adding them directly to the partitions themselves? For example 

Alter table only receiptitems_202412_1 add constraint foreign key fk_2024_1 on (receiptid) references receipts_202412_1 (id). 

I think this will help because it won’t have to check all partitions of receipts for the id right? For additional info this is dealing with millions of records per day. "

My background is in civil engineering (lol) but right now I am working as a Business Analyst for a small logistics company. I developed BI apps (think PowerBI) but I guess now I also assume the responsibility of a data engineer and I am a one-man team. My workflow is as follows:

1. Enterprise data is stored in 3 databases (PostgreSQL, IBM DB2, etc...)

2. I have a target Data Warehouse with a defined schema to consolidate these DBs and feed the data into BI apps.

2. Write SQL scripts for each db to match the Data Warehouse's schema

3. Use python as the medium to run SQL script (pyodbc, psycopg2), do some data wrangling/cleaning/business rules/etc.. (numpy, pandas etc...), and push to the Data Warehouse (sqlalchemy)

4. Use Task Scheduler (lol) to refresh the pipeline daily.

My current problem:

1. Sometimes, the query output is too large that python' memory cannot handle it. 

2. The entire SQL script also runs for the entire db which is not efficient (only recent invoices need to be updated, last year invoices are already settled). My current way around this is to save SQL query output prior to 2024 as a csv file and only run SELECT \* FROM A WHERE DATE>=2024.

3. Absolutely no interface to check the pipeline's status. 

4. In the future, we might need ""live"" data and this does not do that.

5. Preferably the Data Warehouse/SQL/Python/Pipeline everything is hosted on AWS.

What do you suggest can be improved to this? I just need pointers to book/courses/github projects/key concepts etc...

I greatly appreciate everyone's advice."

I'm looking for some advice on the kind of setup/tools/products that would make sense for my situation. I'm in charge of data science in a small team that deploys IoT monitoring devices for power system control in residential and commercial settings. Think monitoring and controlling solar panels, batteries and other electrical power related infrastructure. We collect many different time series, and use it for ML modelling/forecasting and control optimisation.

Current State:

All the data comes in over MQTT, into kinesis, and the kinesis consumers pump it into an InfluxDBv2 timeseries database. Currently we've got about a TB of data and streaming in 1-2 gb per day, but things are growing. The data in this InfluxDB are tagged in such a way that each timeseries is identifiable by the device that created it, the type of data it is (e.g. what is being measured) and the endpoint on the device that it was read from.

To interpret what those flags mean, we have a separate postgres database with meta information that link these timeseries to real information about the site and customer, like geolocation, property name, what type of device it is (e.g. solar panel vs. battery etc..) and lots of other meta information. The timeseries data in the InfluxDB are not usable without first interrogating this meta database to interpret what the timeseries mean.

This is all fine for uses like displaying to a user how much power their solar panels are using right now, but very cumbersome for data science work, for example, getting all solar panel data for the last month for all users is very difficult, you would have to ask the meta database for all the devices first, extract them somewhere, then construct a series of queries for the influx database based on the results of the meta database query.

We also have lots of other disparate data in different places that could be consolidated and would benefit from being in once place that can be queried together with the device data.

Once issue with this setup is that you have to have a giant machine/storage hosting influx sitting idle waiting for occasional data science workloads, and that is expensive.

What Would a Better Setup Look Like?

I generally feel like separating the storage of the data and the compute to query it makes sense. The new AWS S3 tables looks like a possibility, but I am not clear on what the full tooling stack here would look like. I'm not really a data engineer, and so am not well versed in all the options/tools out there and what would make sense for this type of data situation. I will note my team are very invested in AWS and are very good at setting up AWS infrastructure, so a system that can be hosted there would be an easier sell/buy in that something completely separate."

Hi everyone, if someone could give me advice about my situation, I would really appreciate it!  

I’ve just received a data engineer job offer and am now trying to decide if it’s a good opportunity to take.  

I’m currently a data analyst at an amazing company with great benefits. I’ve been here for 2 years, and I like my boss, love the team, and appreciate all the perks the company provides. I recently completed a data engineering bootcamp and have been looking to transition into the data engineering field.  

The salary for the new job offer is the same as my current one, but the benefits are not as good. The holiday allowance, employer pension contributions, and other perks are significantly less favorable. For example, I’d lose the excellent sick pay package I have now, where I’m entitled to 15 weeks of full pay and 15 weeks of half pay. In the new company, I’d only get 5 days of sick pay, followed by statutory sick pay (SSP). I’d also need to work half an hour more each day.  

On top of that, they require me to be in the office three days a week, whereas I currently have a lot of flexibility—only going into the office 1–2 days a week, with the ability to adjust as needed. Essentially, everything about the new offer seems worse than what I currently have.  

I know benefits are just one part of the job, and I recognize how valuable the title and experience would be for my career. But I’m scared of losing everything I have now.  

Any advice?  What would you do in my situation?

I'm a 35-year-old male with a background in finance and accounting, currently working in a financial services company. Over the past few years, I've been the go-to person for problem-solving, automation, and developing VBA solutions and Excel templates for my team in the Finance Department. However, my role shifted to managing the finances of a sister company. What initially seemed like a promotion turned into a toxic and unstructured environment where you have to to be the clerk, the accountant and the manager. Despite repeated promises of a salary increase and a more fitting role, nothing has changed in the last three years except them hiring a manager for me and promising me that he will be hiring his team now and I go back to support my old team with analysis and excel stuff.

Now, as my contract renewal approaches, I'm seriously considering leaving to pursue a career in data engineering—a field that aligns more closely with my passions and skills. My plan is to return to my home country, attend a free data engineering bootcamp, and start working on projects (free or paid) until I can generate income from freelancing or secure a remote job.

Here’s where I currently stand:

* **SQL & Python:** Beginner
* **Power BI:** Intermediate
* **Excel & VBA:** Advanced

I'm looking for a career that’s more fulfilling in several ways:

* **Location:** I want stability in my home country.
* **Time:** I need a job that doesn’t consume 10-12 hours a day.
* **Relevance:** I want work that matches my passion, so I can handle workload pressures with enthusiasm.

**Why data engineering instead of data analysis?**  
I want my work to be measurable—something concrete where the output is clear and undeniable. With data analysis, especially in less mature companies or regions, subjective opinions can often overshadow data-driven insights, making the work feel frustrating and unclear.

**Has anyone made a similar transition?** I’d love to hear your advice on whether this is the right move and how best to make the leap. Any insights would be greatly appreciated!"

I hate this book and think it's outdated.

I'm starting as a DE at Meta and have previously worked as a DE at another social media company with data scaling into the petabytes. The principles in this book seem outdated as more fact and dimension table modeling has moved toward big topic tables with redundancy that seem to take advantage of the columnar nature of these large data warehousing systems. That makes some of the material of the book and modeling suggestions like keeping free text fields in separate dimension tables outdated.

That and, I find this book to be badly written. It tries to introduce industries like healthcare and shipping in order to demonstrate how to translate business problems into data models, but it approaches this conveying attempt in ways that I find frustrating:

1. The industries themselves aren't given enough background. For example, this paragraph is dropped without proper context:

>The chart of accounts likely associates the organization cost center with the account. Typically, the organization attributes provide a complete rollup from cost center to department to division, for example. If the corporate general ledger combines data across multiple business units, the chart of accounts would also indicate the business unit or subsidiary company. Obviously, charts of accounts vary from organization to organization. They're often extremely complicated, with hundreds or even thousands of cost centers in large organizations. In this case study vignette, the chart of accounts naturally decomposes into two dimensions. One dimension represents accounts in the general ledger, whereas the other represents the organization rollup.

Now, on my own as a reader I have to look up a chart of accounts, cost centers and corporate general ledgers to have context into the data modeling suggestions the authors will later suggest.

2. The background that is given is interspersed from topic to topic rather than given upfront. I'm having to learn about the business while (learning about ) modeling rather than learning about the business, asessing the patterns, and then translating that into modeling.  
3. It seems to make up it's own jargon.  
4. It choose paragraphs in places where diagrams might be more appropriate  
5. Too little example exploratory SQL especially in places where storage or processing issues are mentioned as bottlenecks

I was wondering if there were modern resources that go over data modeling with less of these issues and more context in big data. I'm slogging through this book and hate it."

This is incredibly useful to me for scraping multiple times daily with a live baseball database. The only thing is, I would prefer if pandas had this built in to the package, and I did open a pull request about it, but I think they are too busy to care. 

Maybe it is just a stupid idea? I would like to know your opinions on whether or not pandas should have upsert. I think my code handles it pretty well as a workaround, but I feel like Pandas could just do this as part of their package. Maybe I am just thinking about this all wrong?

But if you aim to grow as a software engineer and programmer, it's a bad idea to only learn one language.

Yes, learning infra and DevOps skills might make yourself more immediately attractive to employers. But let's assume you want to prioritize learning a second language besides Python (whether that's because you just think it'd be more fun, or you've got the other skills down, or you want to open other doors in the tech sector). What's the next language you should look into?

I'm considering three languages for my next bout of serious study as a entry-to-mid level DE (2 YOE). Please keep that naivete in mind if I say anything too idiotic.

\* **Scala**: Despite the downers, I'm still inclined to weigh this one heavily. Every programmer should study a functional language, so the saying goes, and Scala is more useful for Data Engineers than Haskell. Scala also has some synergy with the other two languages on this list (via the JVM and immutability).

* I don't even know if idiomatic Spark pipelines in Scala are written in strict FP, but studying it would still check that box.
* The subset of Scala which is relevant to DE is probably more limited in scope and so would honestly not even be that hard to keep fresh. After studying it to learn FP, you could probably just commit to retain enough knowledge for writing Spark UDFs and reading source code, not for entire backends.

\* **Java**: Upstream of Spark sits Spring Boot in most (?) large-scale data architectures. If you want to work cross-team with backend engineers or transition roles gradually, java is a good pick. Apache Flink + Kafka also have Java as their first-class citizen. JVM knowledge is helpful for debugging Spark.

* My understanding is very, very few people use the Java Spark API, both due to the syntax and more deployment challenges vs. Scala.
* Scala is also superior for ML as I understand it but I wouldn't learn either for that purpose.

\* **Rust**: Besides the backend, another upstream (downstream?) component in DE are analytical query processing engines. While Rust can also be used in distributed backends, compared with Java it would bring you closer to this side of data engineering. Rust now seems to be the main high-speed language of choice for accelerating Python (outside of ML) and lies underneath Polars and DataFusion. As a compiled language with low-level functionality, it could also open up entirely new fields of programming.

* I can't speak from experience to this, but: I suspect having Rust on your r\*S\*M\*e will distinguish you at Python shops (in DE or otherwise). It'll give a strong signal that you are someone who both understands the limitations of Python and has the tools to move beyond them. Yes HR might not know, but that's why you go for referrals.

Over the next decade or so, I plan to explore all of these choices, but for right now I have started learning Rust. At some point in a year or so I'll take a brief detour in Scala for the obligatory stint in FP + bone up on Spark knowledge. If I was keen on exiting the DE field ASAP for some reason, Java would probably be the fastest way towards a career in backend dev.

\---

I hope this was helpful to others considering what language to learn next!

Which of these languages would you say is the most useful/attractive second language for a DE to acquire?

What languages have you learned and used over the course of your career?

Are you contented with Python, SQL, Bash-GPT, and YAML?"

Leadership is pretty firm on this—it’s non-negotiable that we don’t end up with any accidental oversharing of data, especially since we work with SAP ERP and deal with some really specific and sensitive data.

   * The specifics of how the data might get through a governance tool and into a BI tool are hazy to me and if possible some descriptions of potential solutions would be appreciated.  We're using Power BI presently though Tableau could potentially be under consideration.

That said my searches around the above typically turn up multiple pages related to how the tools can crawl BI for cataloging purposes, I'm more interested in making information flow in the other direction after passing through access control.

If I have everything here backwards... What solutions might address my fantasy use case?"

My background is dev and I'm a software engineer so all the coding part is not a problem.

The thing is I don't know what else to do right now, ofc I'm focusing on learning inside the job but I would like to still do a bit more outside of it, I probably should read more books but I read a lot already and it feels pointless now, I always end up changing to another one or not finishing them.

For practice, it feels almost impossible to have good practice for this field outside an actual job.

I'm 25 and still kind of junior in this field yet, my target would be to work in a product company like a fintech or machine learning related in a high level, I feel I'm still far from that.

Any thoughts/ideas on things I could do now to keep improving and get to the next level?"

1hn700h,How can i do delta live table with unmanaged table?,2,0,Useful-Doughnut32,2024-12-27 04:36:20,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1hn700h/how_can_i_do_delta_live_table_with_unmanaged_table/,False,False,False,False,1,"
Hi everyone, i need some advice on this ingestion. We have a lot of table that ingest every day into our ADLS. However, these tables have no watermark. We cannot do delta load and we are doing full load into parquet everyday. Right now, i am trying the unity catalog in databricks. I like the idea of delta live table. But from my understanding after reading the documents, it has to be a managed table in databricks, right? I simply just want those delta live table features using unmanaged table. Is that possible considering that my data have no watermark and is a daily full load data? Even CDC is not possible?

Thanks and Merry Christmas to you all!"
1hn6hdr,Confused about my trajectory (5 years of experience),2,6,Overall_Cry2986,2024-12-27 04:06:48,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1hn6hdr/confused_about_my_trajectory_5_years_of_experience/,False,False,False,False,0,"Hey ya’ll,

Been at my current company for about 5 years now.
Started off as a start up and wore all kinds of hats related to data and python. Was a junior SQL developer at my previous job.

Eventually I started building the data warehouse on GCP. I scheduled cron jobs for different datasets, tables, etc. Created data flows from cloud storage all the way to the reporting level. Sometimes I would build random dashboards and other scripts for various teams. Sort of see myself as half back end, half data.

My stack is all GCP. (Cloud run, functions, bigquery, compute engine) Everything is python and sql.

Since I’m not in a tech company, most of my learning and self development has been on my own.
Planning on converting most of my work to airflow in 2025 and working on getting my first GCP certs.

I somewhat manage a contractor who helps scrape data and throws files into the cloud storage buckets. If there’s an API, I build the data flow myself.

My question is, given that I’ve been doing this for 5 years and don’t really see any kind of upwards mobility in the company, what should I be doing? I love the company, culture and work life balance, but can’t help but feel like I’m getting bored and could be working on something interesting.

Also would be curious what ya’ll think my salary should be. I’m in the US."

I’m the only “Data person” in my company. I am solely responsible for all “front end” and “back end” analytics and data functions to make it brief. Pipelines, wrangling, cleaning, storing, infrastructure, all the way to the actual reporting + deriving insights, and delivering them to the team + stakeholders. 

I’m in legal cannabis, so the lack of structure is to be expected, but I’ve been given the title “Senior Data Manager”.

What would YOU dub this role however, as I might be able to have it changed name wise to better reflect on my cv and such moving forward. This one stumped me though because I’m basically the “Data Manager” but I’ve never seen this term used, and worry about it portraying what exactly I do when read on paper. 

Appreciate you guys and happy holidays 

Edit: I want to be a data engineer primarily, just what I’m into."

I assume some people here have similar PD stipends lol.

I went though a bunch of old posts and compiled this list:

- Book: Snowflake Data Engineering (Manning)
- Book: The Data Warehouse Toolkit
- Book: Designing Data-Driven Applications
- Book: Fundamentals of DE
- Book: The Data Warehouse Toolkit (Kimball)

- Udemy: dbt and airbyte courses
- Udemy: Alan Simon 
- Udemy: Data Engineering Fundamentals

What are some hands on certifications or courses that you all liked, and learned a lot from? Any AWS crash courses?

If I could find a beginner friendly, basic course to follow and stay on track, I just need guidance from beginning to end of a pipeline. 

I learn best with hands on application while reading, so I joined the DE Zoomcamp, but the videos / slack approach are a bit unorganized - this makes it hard for me to follow, because I have a learning disability. 

I know googling stuff is normal, and I already do this at work and when I first learned to code, but damn is it overwhelming to do this after the first video. I’m tired after working and cleaning everyday, so it’s the extra mental hurdle BEFORE getting to learn that makes it hard to stay engaged.

1hmy8qw,Change over time in messy json blobs?,1,6,WillowWorker,2024-12-26 21:15:41,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1hmy8qw/change_over_time_in_messy_json_blobs/,False,False,False,False,0,"I've inherited a table with 3 columns - ID, DATE, and ""DATA"" where DATA is a massive, nested json blob. Even worse, the structure of the json blob is different for different types of customers, can be incomplete AND has changed quite a lot over time. New keys have been added and values have changed - for example a field that used to be 0/1 int is now boolean, etc. Is there some way I can visualize or quickly gather information about different 'epochs' of the data. For example, I want to know that something like 'is_active' was 0/1 int until 3/31 then became boolean, or that key 'test_04' was added on 11/01. I could do it all by hand but I was hoping there might be some sort of library or solution I can dump this into and get a nice report before I start working through this."

**Background:**

I am a data engineer for a construction company. Company uses Azure. I have experience with Azure services but only through the REST APIs (blob storage, Azure Search, Doc Intelligence, AI, etc). Do not have access to the portal because of IT permissions.

Not that much experience on Synapse besides personal projects. No experience at all with Streaming.

**Study time:** 2-3 hours a day (plus a little more on weekends) for 3 weeks.

**Exam Experience**: Took it at a test center after having trouble trying to do it online. I relied quite a bit on using the documentation. Got a total of 45 questions and barely finished on time. My impression was that it was a fair exam and similar questions to SkillCertPro. A surprise was the amount of questions related to version Control about 5-6). You can only have 5 tabs open at max in Azure Learn. No \`Ctrl F\`.

**Resources:**

* MS Learn Course ""Data Engineering on Microsoft Azure""
   * [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/azure-data-engineer/?practice-assessment-type=certification#two-ways-to-prepare](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/azure-data-engineer/?practice-assessment-type=certification#two-ways-to-prepare)
   * I went over all the modules in the course. While they may cover more details than what is covered in the exam, they helped me understand the problem that each solution is trying to solve.
* Tybul on Azure
   * [https://www.youtube.com/@TybulOnAzure](https://www.youtube.com/@TybulOnAzure)
   * Recommended. While his videos are longer than most, he does an excellent job sharing the required background and context on each of the Azure services.
* MeasureUp exam
   * I got the DP203 package that consists of a pool of about 140 questions. Not that great of a resource, especially for the price.
* SkillCertPro
   * Recommended. I felt a lot of the questions were similar to those included in the practice exams
* Udemy DP-203 - Data Engineering on Microsoft Azure by Alan Rodriguez
   * Not recommended. I left the course 30% in. He repeats the MS Learn Docs without adding anything new in my opinion. Plus he cuts the videos into very small chunks which personally I do not enjoy
